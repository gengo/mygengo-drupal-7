myGengo Plugin for Drupal 7
Copyright (C) 2011, see LICENSE

=== Installation
Just unpack the zip into your drupal/modules directory and 
activate the myGengo module in Drupal under <Administration/Modules/Other>.

=== Configuration
The config page of the module is under <Administration/Configuration/Regional and Language/myGengo>. 
Fill in the public and private keys. You can find them on your myGengo account page under
<Account/API settings>. 
Set the 'Default Callback URL' to http://<domain>/<drupal root>/?q=mygengo/callback or 
http://<domain>/<drupal root>/mygengo/callback if you use URL rewrting. Save the changes.
You can delete the local database of jobs and fetch a fresh one with the 'Rebuild database' link.
Use this sparingly, only if the system somehow desychonized with myGengo!

The module uses two permissions. One to use myGengo for translation (submit, cancel, approve,...)
and one to admister the settings. To be able to cancel, approve and reject translations a user 
must be able to see the myGengo Dashboard block.

=== Translate
Either use the 'Translate with myGengo' menu item or navigate to the content view (admin/content)
to submit a whole node for translation.

In the translation form add target languages to the job and submit it to myGengo. The job will
show up on your Dashboard.

=== Administer
The module adds a block to the Dashboard were you can see all jobs submitted. Depending on the
status of the job you can review, comment on, view or cancel it with the respective links.
